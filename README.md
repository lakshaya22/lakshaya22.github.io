The json data can be edited from the app.js file, there is a tree variable that content all the nodes, for every node that comes inside a parent nodes array has to be given an level, for the code to work properly in scenario for closing the adjacent nodes while a particular node is opened.

Instead of the arrow thing given in the assignment I have provided with the horrizontal scroll and the lines are not there connecting the node, I know it can be achieved by using canvas but I am not that familiar with it, so I have to go through it once.

This code less similar to the assignment given, but I was able to come up with this only in the 5 hours of time that I got from my office work.
